# fastgltf

A superfast SIMD powered glTF 2.0 parser written in C++17 with minimal dependencies. Unlike other
glTF parsers, it does not automatically load textures and external buffers to allow the user to
optimise to their liking. It does, however, load embedded data and also decodes base64 encoded
buffers using high speed SIMD algorithms.

fastgltf also provides a C99 API header which includes all the features of the C++ API so that you
can use fastgltf with virtually any language you want.

By utilising simdjson, this library can take advantage of SSE4, AVX2, AVX512, and ARM Neon.

## Features

fastgltf supports glTF 2.0:
- [x] glTF JSON files
- [x] GLB binary files
- [x] Scenes, nodes, meshes
- [x] Accessors, buffer views, buffers
- [x] Materials, textures, images, samplers
- [x] Animations
- [x] Skins
- [x] Cameras
- [x] Morph targets, sparse accessors
- [ ] Extra data

fastgltf supports a number of glTF extensions:
- [x] EXT_meshopt_compression
- [x] EXT_texture_webp
- [x] KHR_lights_punctual
- [x] KHR_texture_basisu
- [x] KHR_texture_transform
- [x] KHR_mesh_quantization
- [x] MSFT_texture_dds

fastgltf brings many utilities:
- [x] SIMD powered base64 buffer decoder
- [x] Can decompose transform matrices, so you only ever have translation, rotation, and scale.
- [x] Allows writing directly to mapped GPU buffers for direct uploads, reducing copies.

## Usage

fastgltf is built using C++17 and only depends on simdjson, which is downloaded automatically in
the CMake script (can be disabled with `FASTGLTF_DOWNLOAD_SIMDJSON=OFF`). The library is tested on
GCC 9, GCC 10, Clang 12, and MSVC 14 (Visual Studio 2022) using CI. The project uses a simple CMake
3.11 script, and can be simply used by adding fastgltf as a subdirectory. Also, fastgltf is
available from [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).

Tests and examples are also available and can be built by enabling the respective options, `FASTGLTF_ENABLE_TESTS`
and `FASTGLTF_ENABLE_EXAMPLES`. fastgltf will then require a few extra dependencies for the test
framework, and OpenGL tools, which have to be downloaded by running `fetch_test_deps.py`.

### C++ API

```cpp
#include <fastgltf_parser.hpp>
#include <fastgltf_types.hpp>

void load(std::filesystem::path path) {
    // Creates a Parser instance. Optimally, you should reuse this across loads, but don't use it
    // across threads. To enable extensions you have to pass them into the parser's constructor.
    fastgltf::Parser parser;

    // The GltfDataBuffer class is designed for re-usability of the same JSON string. It contains
    // utility functions to load data from a std::filesystem::path, copy from an existing buffer,
    // or re-use an already existing allocation. Note that it has to outlive the process of every
    // parsing function you call.
    fastgltf::GltfDataBuffer data;
    data.loadFromFile(path);

    // This loads the glTF file into the gltf object and parses the JSON. For GLB files, use
    // fastgltf::Parser::loadBinaryGLTF instead.
    auto gltf = parser.loadGLTF(&data, path.parent_path(), fastgltf::Options::None);
    if (parser.getError() != fastgltf::Error::None) {
        // File doesn't exist, couldn't be read, or is not a valid JSON document.
    }

    // With this call to parse you let fastgltf serialize the whole JSON document into the
    // glTF data structures. If desired, you can pass OR'd category enums that will exclude
    // certain glTF aspects from being loaded.
    if (gltf->parse() != fastgltf::Error::None) {
        // Most likely the asset does not follow the glTF spec. Though perhaps fastgltf doesn't
        // handle something correctly, so please let me know.
    }
    
    // Optionally, you can now also call the glTF::validate method. This will more strictly
    // enforce the glTF spec and is not needed most of the time, though I would certainly
    // recommend it in a development environment or when debugging to avoid mishaps.

    // You obtain the asset with this call. This can only be done once, and all successive
    // calls will return a nullptr. The parser and glTF object can be destroyed safely after
    // this call.
    std::unique_ptr<fastgltf::Asset> asset = gltf->getParsedAsset();
}
```

All the nodes, meshes, buffers, textures, ... can now be accessed through the `fastgltf::Asset`
type. References in between objects are done with a single `size_t`, which is used to index into
the various vectors in the asset. fastgltf heavily utilizes standard containers like std::variant
and std::optional to enforce safety for the user.

### C99 API

```c
#include <fastgltf_c.h>

void load(const char* path, const char* directory) {
    // Creates a parser object
    fastgltf_parser* parser = fastgltf_create_parser(0);
    
    fastgltf_gltf_data_buffer* data = fastgltf_create_gltf_data_buffer_from_path(path);
    
    // For GLB files, use fastgltf_load_binary_gltf
    fastgltf_gltf* gltf = fastgltf_load_gltf(parser, data, directory, OptionsDontRequireValidAssetMember);
    if (fastgltf_get_parser_error(parser) != ErrorNone) {
        // error
    }
    
    // Tell fastgltf to parse the whole glTF structure. Optionally, you can parse individual
    // aspects of glTF files by calling the various parse methods.
    fastgltf_parse_all(gltf);

    // You can now destroy the parser and JSON data. It is advised, however, to reuse parsers.
    fastgltf_destroy_gltf_data_buffer(data);
    fastgltf_destroy_parser(parser);
    
    // You can now query the parsed asset and destroy the glTF object. 
    fastgltf_asset* asset = fastgltf_get_parsed_asset(gltf);
    fastgltf_destroy_gltf(gltf);
    
    // Use the parsed asset here.
    
    fastgltf_destroy_asset(asset);
}
```

## Performance

In the following chapter I'll show some graphs on how fastgltf compares to the two most used glTF
libraries, cgltf and tinygltf. I've disabled loading of images and buffers to only compare the
JSON parsing and serialization of the glTF data. I create these graphs using a spreadsheet that you
can find [here][spreadsheet-link].
These numbers were tested using Catch2's benchmark tool on a Ryzen 5800X with 32GB of RAM using
VS 2022.

First of I compared the performance with embedded buffers that are encoded with base64. This uses
the [2CylinderEngine asset](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/master/2.0/2CylinderEngine)
which contains a 1.7MB embedded buffer. fastgltf includes an optimised base64 decoding algorithm
that can take advantage of AVX2, SSE4, and Neon. With this asset, fastgltf is **7.33 times faster**
than tinygltf using RapidJSON and **2 times faster** than cgltf.

[Buggy.gltf](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/master/2.0/Buggy) is another
excellent test subject, as it's a 15k line long JSON. This shows the raw serialization speed of
all the parsers. In this case fastgltf is **2.3 times faster** than tinygltf and **1.7 times faster**
than cgltf.

## Acknowledgments

**The major speedup comes from the awesome [`simdjson`](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson) JSON
library which can use a multitude of different SIMD intrinsics to increase JSON decoding speed. The
library really shows off at massive JSON files, by parsing around 8GB/s.**

The SIMD-based base64 decoding algorithms come from
[Wojciech Mu≈Ça](http://0x80.pl/notesen/2016-01-17-sse-base64-decoding.html#avx2-version), which can
usually nearly triple the decoding speed with AVX2.
